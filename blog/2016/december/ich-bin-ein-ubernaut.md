I have been a Dreamhost customer for years, on shared hosting, and have been fairly satisfied.

Six months ago, I decided to move from shared hosting to a Dreamhost VPS, because I wanted to do more, like running Node.js and configure my server.

The price went from $10 to $15 a month, which I think was quite expensive, considering that Dreamhost VPS does not grant root access, and all in all does not give you a whole lot more than regular shared hosting..

Still, I was unable to find a suitable alternative..

Until I stumbled upon [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/)!

*"Uberspace.de is a platform of technicians for technicians and all who want to be. We make hosting for command line enthusiasts, data protectionists, control freaks, Unix friends, DIY's .."*

Pay what you want.
Whilst the minimum price is 1 euro, the recommended monthly rate is between 5 and 10 euros.



Programming:

Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, node.js, Erlang, Lua, Go, GCC, git, Subversion, Mercurial, ...

MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, CouchDB, MongoDB, Redis, ...

It was easy to connect to mysql via a ssh tunnel from Workbench. There is also webbased interfaces, Datamine and PHPMyAdmin.

Cronjobs, services, ..

You can also install software via LinuxBrew, which is awesome!

Let's Encrypt - works.

No cPanel, no GUI, all command-line.
