It seems like - and is actually true as well! that we are tracked where ever we go these days.

Whenever we use our smartphone, log into the internet, yes, even when we use a modern car or take a stroll to the shopping mall, we are tracked. Information is being gathered about where we are located, what pages we have visited on the internet, etc.

So, I thought to myself: do my sites really have to track you as well?

In the European Union, we are required by law to comply with the [Cookie Directive](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm), which basically means that we need to at least inform our visitors that we are collecting cookies and link to a privacy policy page explaining what cookies are, and whatnot.

Ironically, a cookie is set on your machine so that you don't have to click the 'Agree with use of cookies' ...

The Cookie Directive has unfortunately meant that you are being met with annoying pop-ups 'all over the place' - I agree with the principle, but it is just too much.

So, in order to go completely cookie-free, and avoid all the EU cookie regulation sheenanigans, I have decided to get rid of Google Analytics and Disqus from my sites.

Also, of course, this has the added benefit of privacy, which is nice.

I don't want to track, or help to track, anyone.

## Google Analytics ##
Saving the request to the Google servers.

Avoid setting tracking cookie.

Not really useful to me, since I don't monetise my site and haven't got that many visitors anyway.

And since I don't want my sites to be collecting information from you, my visitors.

## Disqus ##
I have been meaning to switch from using Disqus, but I haven't really found a suitable alternative.

Own the data myself.

Do not track people.

I discovered that Disqus were collecting information about my visitors so that they could serve targeted ads, 'community' suggestions, etc.

Disqus is a so-called 'free' service, but what we are really paying them with is information.

## Self-hosted comments ##
I am now using [HashOver 2.0](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next) PHP comment system.

The comments are stored safely on my server, in plain text files.

The email addresses are encrypted so in the highly unlikely event that someone manages to compromise the data, they won't be able to steal any personal information, because they don't have the encryption key.

## You are welcome ##

I hope that you will appreciate not being tracked :)

And everyone, except the cookie monster, will be pleased to know that this site is absolutely cookie-free!
