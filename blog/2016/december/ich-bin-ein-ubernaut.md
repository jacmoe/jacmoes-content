I have been a Dreamhost customer for years, on shared hosting, and have been fairly satisfied.

Six months ago, I decided to move from shared hosting to a Dreamhost VPS, because I wanted to do more, like running Node.js and configure my server.

The price went from $10 to $15 a month, which I think was quite expensive, considering that Dreamhost VPS does not grant root access, and all in all does not give you a whole lot more than regular shared hosting..

Still, I was unable to find a suitable alternative.. 

Until I stumbled upon [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/)!

## Uberspace ##

*"Uberspace.de is a platform of technicians for technicians and all who want to be. We make hosting for command line enthusiasts, data protectionists, control freaks, Unix friends, DIY's .."*

### Features ###

#### Pay what you want ####

Uberspace is a pay-what-you-want hosting provider.

You simply set the desired monthly fee on your account page.

Currently, the minimum fee is 1 euro, but the recommended fee is between 5 and 10 euros a month.

The rationale behind the 'pay what you want' policy is that everyone ought to have a voice on the net, so if find yourself low on cash, Uberspace is still your host.

You can't use credit card, Paypal or other 'services' to pay for your hosting, only direct money transfer or Bitcoin transaction - for political reasons.

They are concerned about privacy and ethics. And I like that a lot.

The first month is free, so there is nothing to lose. :)

#### Programming languages ####

Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, node.js, Erlang, Lua, Go, GCC, git, Subversion, Mercurial, ...

You can have a custom `php.ini`, install extensions, PECL, ..

#### Databases ####

MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, CouchDB, MongoDB, Redis, ...

It was easy to connect to mysql via a ssh tunnel from MySQL Workbench. There is also webbased interfaces, Datamine and PHPMyAdmin.

#### Goodies ####

You add, delete, stop and start daemons (services) easily. They can run scripts, applications, whatever you like.

You can also install software via LinuxBrew, which is awesome!

Uberspace has support for Let's Encrypt - just a matter of running an Uberspace script or two.

#### Lose the GUI ####

No cPanel, no GUI, all command-line.

There are lots of 'uberspace' scripts that can help you configure your Uberspace 'box' the way you want it.

For a command-line geek like me, that is perfect!

#### Have fun ####


#### Be responsible ####
