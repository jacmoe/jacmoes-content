*"Uberspace.de is a platform of technicians for technicians and all who want to be. We make hosting for command line enthusiasts, data protectionists, control freaks, Unix friends, DIY's .."*

Pay what you want.
Whilst the minimum price is 1 euro, the recommended monthly rate is between 5 and 10 euros.
I like that. A symbolic amount of 1 euro would have kept me hosted.

Programming:

- Perl
- Python
- PHP
- Ruby
- node.js
- Erlang
- Lua
- Go (golang)
- GCC
- git
- Subversion
- Mercurial

And databases:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

It was easy to connect to mysql via a ssh from Workbench..

Cronjobs

You can also install software via LinuxBrew, which is awesome!
