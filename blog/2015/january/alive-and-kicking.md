Description: A bit over a year ago I pulled the plug and went off-line. I had reached a point where I simply had no choice but to unplug and regroup. But I'm not dead yet.

It can be a real adventure to have a life.

Last year was the culmination of several years with increasing levels of

Exhaustion<br/>
Lack of motivation<br/>
Frustration<br/>
Difficulty with paying attention, concentrating<br/>
Inability to focus on something other than the negative<br/>
Not taking care of myself<br/>

I was in a state of permanent fight or flight and every day was a bad day.

It has been brewing for a long time, and while it's easy to categorize it as a mid-life crisis, it is not that simple. :)

Since I moved from Norway to Denmark in 2004 with my girlfriend, we've moved house a staggering 7 times! And switched jobs as well. All the while we were adjusting to a new country.

And in 2008 I was laid off because of the global crisis: the order books were completely empty at the company where I worked. And it proved to be impossible to get jobs as an unskilled worker.<br/>
I am a teacher, but I graduated in 1992 and have been out of it for far too long.

And thus I became a house-husband, living off my spouse, and it was really not sustainable at all.

Eventually, I completely unplugged myself. No only from The Internet, but from Real Life as well.

I simply couldn't cope with all the projects, all the people, all the obligations.<br/>
I felt like a complete failure, and I simply needed time to (re)focus.

Then, in October 2013, on what seems to be a whim, I decided to follow my life-long dream of becoming a chef, and enrolled at Copenhagen Hospitality College.

And embarked on something that has been - and still is - shatteringly challenging. I am 46 years old, for Christ sakes. :)

My new journey is only just begun. And I am looking forward to seeing what's next.

I hereby end this post with one of my most favorite quotes:
>To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.
> -- <cite>Kierkegaard</cite>

So, evidently, I am not dead (yet). I am still kicking. Actually, I now kick better than I ever did before. And, I am starting to plug myself in again, including - but not limited to - The Internet.


Take care ;)
