After more than 6 months in the making, the new Ogre Wiki is now live!

This has by far been my biggest solo-project, and I am both proud and happy to see that it succeeded.

See it in action here: [Ogre Wiki](http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php)

It is almost exactly 5 years ago that the Ogre project got a wiki, powered by MediaWiki, and now it's time to move to the next level.

It is my hope that the new wiki will last at least 5 years, and start a new era if Ogre wiki goodness.

The new wiki is powered by [Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware](http://info.tikiwiki.org/tiki-index.php).
