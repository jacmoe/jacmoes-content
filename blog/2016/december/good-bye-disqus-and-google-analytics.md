## Google Analytics ##
Saving the request to the Google servers.

Avoid setting tracking cookie.

Not really useful to me, since I don't monetise my site and haven't got that many visitors anyway.

And since I don't want my sites to be collecting information from you, my visitors.

## Disqus ##
I have been meaning to switch from using Disqus, but I haven't really found a suitable alternative.

Own the data myself.

Do not track people.

I discovered that Disqus were collecting information about my visitors so that they could serve targeted ads, 'community' suggestions, etc.

Disqus is a so-called 'free' service, but what we are really paying them with is information.

## Self-hosted comments ##
I am now using [HashOver 2.0](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next) PHP comment system.

The comments are stored safely on my server, in plain text files.

The email addresses are encrypted so in the highly unlikely event that someone manages to compromise the data, they won't be able to steal any personal information, because they don't have the encryption key.

## You are welcome ##

I hope that you will appreciate not being tracked :)
