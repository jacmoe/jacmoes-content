So, why did I remove the letters from my keyboard?

Did I do it because it's cool, or is there a deeper meaning behind the madness of it?

The answer is: both reasons. :p

I've been a programmer for a long time, and since I am Danish, I've been using a Danish (Nordic) keyboard layout - and it sucks! because the { } and [ ] and @ and $ are all available only by using the Alt-Gr key. Thus making programming a lot more tedious and RSI-inducing.

I've also been lusting for the [Das Keyboard](http://www.daskeyboard.com/) , but it's awfully expensive! The Geek Factor is pretty high:


> "Das Keyboard compares to the legendary IBM Model M. Its best-in-class, mechanical, gold-plated key switches provide a tactile and audible click that makes typing a joy".

## The Reason

To be honest, I ended up with a blank keyboard by happenstance: I have a Danish keyboard and wanted to use an American keyboard layout. And since several letters were worn off already, I simply decided to scrape off the rest of the letters with a kitchen knife. :)

Now I can switch between Danish and American keyboard layouts without getting confused (much). Heck, I can even switch to [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) ! Or even Dvorak (no, I don't think I will). Colemak seems like a good choice, but I think my head would explode if I switched to that in addition to 'going blank'. :p

And, now that I've been using a 'blank' for almost a week, I can already begin to see some improvements.

### Good for typing
I've been touch typing since the 80's. And I've also been cheating a lot since then!

Now, I don't learn much by looking at the keyboard, and am thus forced to touch type without looking down. I am actually happily surprised to learn just how few mistakes I make.

The symbols and the numbers are my main problem now, but that's because I've never bothered to learn their position properly. I already experience quite an improvement, so I can heartily recommend a blank keyboard for typists!

### Good for programming
I am not entirely sure why on Earth I haven't considered switching to using a US keyboard layout a long time ago! I am truly appalled at myself.

Now, the **[ ]** are reachable by my right pinky, and the **{ }** are just a shift key away using the same pinky, all without leaving the home row (much). Before, I had to reach for the number keys and use Alt-Gr and even shift (for the curly braces). The forward and backward slashes are also much easier to get at! And the $ sign is now only a shift key away.. And then I haven't mentioned the ' ' and " " and : and ; which are all at the home row (meaning the position at which the fingers are positioned at the keyboard).

I admit that I feel a bit silly that I only realized this just now. I must be the only programmer in the world who haven't been using the English keyboard layout. But nevertheless, it feels great.

## This is not the end

Okay. I admit it: it will be a long while before I can afford - or even justify - buying a Das Keyboard.

However, my next keyboard is going to be blank. :) And luckily, I found a much, much cheaper alternative: Blank [Keyboard - getDigital.de](http://www.getdigital.de/products/Blank_Keyboard/lng/en)  - around $40.

The only problem I have now is that I am slightly slower to type. And things gets really interesting when I have to type in passwords, etc. But all in all: win!

And, as a bonus: I am an l33t kool kid!

And, yes: I probably should have processed that image of my keyboard and applied an anti-grit filter to it. :)

But the conclusion is: using a blank keyboard is not as hard as it sounds like, especially not if you're used to touch typing. It will make you a better typist. And, as you can see, you don't have to pay a fortune for one such as getDigital.de sells it for dirt cheap.
