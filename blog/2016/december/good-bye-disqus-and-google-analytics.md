## Google Analytics ##
Saving the request to the Google servers.

Avoid setting tracking cookie.

Not really useful to me, since I don't monetise my site and haven't got that many visitors anyway.

## Disqus ##
I have been meaning to switch from using Disqus, but I haven't really found a suitable alternative.

Own the data myself.

Do not track people.

I discovered that Disqus were collecting information about my visitors so that they could target them better with ads, suggestions, etc.

## Self-hosted comments ##
I am now using [Hashover]()
